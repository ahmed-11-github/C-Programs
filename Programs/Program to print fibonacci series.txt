fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc. 
The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.

#include<stdio.h>

int main()

{   
     int n1=0,n2=1,n3,i,digits;

     //Enter number of digits you would like to print
     scanf("%d",&digits);
     printf("%d %d",n1,n2);
     for(i=2;i<digits;i++)       //i=2 because 0 and 1 are allocated to n1 and n2
         { n3=n1+n2;
            n1=n2;
            n2=n3;
            printf(" %d",n3);  // You have to print the n3 in the loop to print every number
          }
    return 0;
}
